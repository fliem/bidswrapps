[BIDS Apps](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io)

[UZH's Science cloud](https://www.s3it.uzh.ch/en/scienceit/infrastructure/sciencecloud.html),
or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), via
[GC3Pie](https://gc3pie.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

The data has to be organized according to the

For the participant-level, processing is submitted to execution
instances in parallel.
